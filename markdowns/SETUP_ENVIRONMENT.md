# Revised Step 1: Environment Setup (WSL2 Ubuntu) - Fixing Dependencies

1.  **Ensure you are in the `xbrl-ai` project directory** (or wherever you created your `venv`).
2.  **Deactivate the current virtual environment (if active):**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
3.  **Delete the existing virtual environment folder (`venv`) to start completely fresh:**
    ```bash
    rm -rf venv
    ```
4.  **Re-create the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
5.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
6.  **Upgrade pip (always good practice in a fresh venv):**
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
7.  **Update your `requirements.txt`:** Modify the `requirements.txt` file in your `xbrl-ai` root directory. Let's specify slightly more recent and potentially compatible versions, especially for `pydantic`, which is often involved in conflicts due to its rapid updates. Docling also likely has specific version requirements.
    ```txt
    # Core dependencies for the XBRL AI project
    # Ingestion Agent
    # Pin specific or slightly broader ranges for known compatible versions
    # Check Docling's documentation for its preferred Pydantic version
    pydantic>=2.0,<3.0 # Use a range compatible with Docling's requirements
    pymupdf>=1.23.0    # PyMuPDF for potential fallbacks/auxiliary PDF operations
    docling>=2.0.0     # Use the latest stable version compatible with your needs
    # Add other potential project dependencies here as we build more agents
    # e.g., fastapi, uvicorn, lxml, requests, etc. (Add these later when needed)
    ```
    *(Save the file)*
8.  **Install Dependencies from the updated `requirements.txt`:** Now, try installing again.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This approach does two things:
*   **Fresh Environment:** Ensures no conflicting packages from a previous attempt remain.
*   **Refined `requirements.txt`:** Uses a version range for `pydantic` (`>=2.0,<3.0`) which is broad enough to allow updates but prevents the resolver from jumping to incompatible major versions immediately. Docling will pull its specific dependencies, and hopefully, this range allows `pip` to find a compatible set.

Try running these steps and let me know if the installation succeeds. If you still encounter issues, the output of the `pip install` command will be crucial for the next troubleshooting step.

# If all good, then move on.
Continuing with the Original Steps (Slightly Adjusted)

## Step 2 (Place Files and Agent Code): Remains the same. Create the directory structure, place the PDF, and save ingestion_agent.py.

## Step 3 (Run the Ingestion Agent Test): Remains the same. Ensure the virtual environment is active (source venv/bin/activate if needed), navigate to the agent directory, and run the test command.

## Step 4 (Verify Environment): Remains the same. Use pip list to check installed packages.
Using requirements.txt ensures that anyone (including your future self) can recreate the exact same Python environment needed for the project by simply running pip install -r requirements.txt after activating the virtual environment. This is much more reliable and clearer than remembering which packages were installed manually.

Please proceed with creating the requirements.txt file and installing the dependencies using the revised Step 1. Then, continue with Steps 2, 3, and 4 to test the Ingestion Agent. Let me know the results!
