Great! Now that the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, let's test the `ingestion_agent.py`.

### How to Test `ingestion_agent.py`

1.  **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active:** Open your WSL2 terminal, navigate to your `xbrl-agentic` project directory, and activate the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd ~/workspace/xbrl-agentic # Adjust this path if your project is elsewhere
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    You should see `(venv)` at the start of your command prompt.

2.  **Navigate to the Agent Directory:** Go to the directory where `ingestion_agent.py` is located.
    ```bash
    cd backend/app/agents
    ```

3.  **Run the Test Command:** Execute the Python script, passing the relative path to your PDF file as an argument. Based on your folder structure shown in the image, the command is:
    ```bash
    python ingestion_agent.py ../../../uploads/OHealthcare-AFS-2024.pdf
    ```

### What to Expect and Look For (Signs of a Successful Test)

When you run the command, the script will output text to your terminal. Hereâ€™s what to look for:

*   **Success Message:** The most important indicator is the final output line: `Success: True`. This means the agent processed the PDF without critical errors.
*   **Message:** You should see `Message: PDF ingestion completed successfully.`.
*   **Number of Pages:** The output will show `Number of Pages: X`, where `X` is the total number of pages in the PDF. This confirms Docling read the document.
*   **Extracted Items:** It will print `Extracted Y tables and Z text blocks.`. This tells you how many items were found.
*   **Sample Output:** The script is designed to print the first few extracted tables (in Markdown) and text blocks (in HTML) to the console for quick inspection. Look at these samples:
    *   **Tables (Markdown):** Check if the table structure looks correct. Do the rows and columns align? Is the content from the PDF accurately captured? For example, does it capture the "Statement of Financial Position" or "Statement of Profit or Loss" tables?
    *   **Text Blocks (HTML):** Check if the text content is preserved. Are there any obvious missing words or garbled characters? Does the basic HTML wrapping (`<p>...</p>`) appear? (Remember, this is a simple placeholder; the focus here is on the *text content*, not complex formatting).

### What Constitutes a "Good" Test Result

A "good" test result for Stage 1 (Ingestion Agent) means:

1.  **No Critical Errors:** The script runs to completion without crashing or throwing unhandled exceptions.
2.  **Correct Data Extraction:** The agent successfully identifies and extracts *some* tables and text blocks from the PDF. It doesn't need to extract *everything* perfectly at this stage, but it should find the major components (like financial statements).
3.  **Accurate Content:** The text content within the extracted tables and text blocks matches the content visible in the original PDF. Minor OCR errors might occur, especially with scanned sections, but the overall meaning should be preserved.
4.  **Structured Output:** The data is returned in the structured format defined by the Pydantic models (`IngestionResult`, `ExtractedTable`, `ExtractedTextBlock`).

If you see `Success: True` and the sample output shows recognizable content from the Omesti Healthcare PDF, then the Ingestion Agent has passed its initial test. You can proceed to the next stage.

Please run the test and share the output if you have any questions or if something seems off. Once confirmed, we can move on to building the Mapping Agent.
